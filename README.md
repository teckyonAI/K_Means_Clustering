# K-Means Clustering: Segmenting Data Using Unsupervised Learning

This project demonstrates the implementation of K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm for data segmentation. Using a provided dataset, the project clusters data points into meaningful groups, visualizing the results for easy interpretation.

## Features
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Implements K-Means Clustering to segment data.
- **Dataset Analysis**: Includes preprocessing and feature scaling for better clustering performance.
- **Visualization**: Generates visual plots to illustrate the clustering process and results.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Step-by-step implementation provided in an easy-to-follow notebook.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/teckyonAI/K_Means_Clustering.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd K_Means_Clustering

3. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

4. Open the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook K_Mean_Clustering.ipynb

## Usage

1. Open `K_Mean Clustering.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Load the provided dataset (`dataset_FreshCo.csv`).
3. Follow the steps to:
    - Preprocess the dataset.
    - Perform K-Means clustering with configurable parameters (e.g., number of clusters).
    - Visualize the clusters and interpret the results.

## Contribution
