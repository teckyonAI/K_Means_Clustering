# K-Means Clustering: Segmenting Data Using Unsupervised Learning

This project showcases the implementation of K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm for segmenting data into meaningful groups. By leveraging a provided dataset, the project demonstrates the clustering process step-by-step, making it easy to understand and visualize the results.

## Features

- **Unsupervised Learning**:
  - Implements the K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment data points into distinct groups.
  - Configurable parameters, such as the number of clusters (`k`), for flexible analysis.
- **Dataset Analysis**:
  - Includes data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, normalization, and feature scaling for better clustering performance.
- **Visualization**:
  - Generates 2D and 3D visualizations, such as scatter plots and cluster boundaries, to illustrate the clustering process and outcomes.
- **Jupyter Notebook**:
  - A detailed, step-by-step notebook (`K_Mean_Clustering.ipynb`) to guide users through the process of clustering and interpreting results.

## Tools and Libraries

This project utilizes the following tools and libraries:
- **Python**: Core programming language for analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the K-Means Clustering algorithm and feature scaling.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating clear and insightful visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For an interactive and step-by-step approach to clustering.

## Dataset

The project uses a sample dataset (`dataset_FreshCo.csv`) for clustering analysis.

### Dataset Overview:
- **Rows**: Individual data points or records.
- **Columns**: Features or variables used for clustering, such as product categories, customer spending patterns, or demographic attributes.

### Example Structure:

| CustomerID | Fresh  | Milk   | Grocery | Frozen | Detergents_Paper | Delicassen |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|--------|------------------|------------|
| 1          | 12669  | 9656   | 7561    | 214    | 2674             | 1338       |
| 2          | 7057   | 9810   | 9568    | 1762   | 3293             | 1776       |
| ...        | ...    | ...    | ...     | ...    | ...              | ...        |

## Results

- **Cluster Formation**:
  - Segments data points into meaningful groups based on feature similarity.
- **Visualization Insights**:
  - Provides graphical representations of clusters for easy interpretation.
- **Actionable Insights**:
  - Identifies patterns or groups in the data, useful for customer segmentation, product recommendations, and market analysis.
